# readmeCTF spring 2021

This is the repository for a Jeopardy-style CTF with web, steganography and reverse-engineering challenges that was hidden in a CTF article written for the 2nd edition of the student magazine "readme", spring 2020.

There are four challenges in total, a web-based challenge, a steganography challenge, as well as a reverse-engineering challenge. The last challenge is a riddle, requiring sleuth in order to identify how to access the last flag.
